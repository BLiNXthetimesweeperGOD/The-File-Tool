Huge thanks to PatrickHamster (Bart≈Çomiej Duda) for letting me use their Xbox swizzle code! The original can be found here:

The Original Xbox XIP unpacker is based on this program by MaTiAz and JayFoxRox:

The Nintendo SARC/SZS unpacker was made using this documentation:
https://mk8.tockdom.com/wiki/SARC_(File_Format)
https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Yaz0_(File_Format)


Usage instructions:
Using this is as easy as running "File Tool.py" and selecting a file.
Files will be output in a folder named after the input file. 
Files are not saved relative to the folder containing the script itself.

Example:
"R:/Test folder/XBAHKS.xip" will unpack to "R:/Test folder/XBAHKS/"

If the script is in "R:/Weird Snake Programs/", the files will still go in "R:/Test folder/XBAHKS/"
